# Blueprints Extended Plugin
by [Aashish Vasudevan](www.aashishvasudevan.com)

## Overview
This UE4 plugin was mainly made to address some or all of these things:
* Making a c++ project when blueprint would have been fine just because some functions were unavailabe
* Rewriting or copying certain c++/blueprint functions from other projects which are useful in almost every project
* Other general functions which either take time to write purely in blueprints or are easier to implement in c++
